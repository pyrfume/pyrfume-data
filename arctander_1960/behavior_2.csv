826,"Sweet-fruity, slightly oily and floral odor of Jasmin type."

828,"Refined, oily-peachy and extraordinarily tenacious odor. More Peach-like, less Nut-like than Nonanolide-1,4."
829,"Very powerful and very tenacious, sweet creamy, Nut-1ike odor with a heavy fruity undertone. The undiluted material displays a rather coumarinic sharpness in its topnote, but at concentrations of O.10; or lower, it seems to grow in volume, sweetness and oilycreamy softness."

857,"Mild, oily-ethereal, faintly herbaceous odor of good tenacity."
858,"Faint, oily-rosy odor of considerable tenacity. The odor of the undiluted material is not really pleasant, but the effect of the Decylether in perfume compositions can be quite attractive."

922,"Peculiar, wartn-herbaceous-floral odor with a woody undertone. The odor has sometimes been compared to that of the “Strawberrytree” (Mediterranean Arbutus), at other times it seems that the observer has great difficulties in describing the odor in common terms."
923,"Typical musky, sweet odor of great tenacity and fixative power. When compared to Ambrettolide, the DHA is less floral, somewhat weaker and lacks the radiant beauty of the.4mbrettolide. The animal notes are slightly more perceptible in the DHA, and it should not be considered as a cheaper replacement for .4mbrettolide."
924,"Sweet-herbaceous, quite powerful odor, less candylike and more dry, almost woody, as compared to Anethole. The overall impression is that of a ‘-clean” odor, not as “round” and “full”” as Anethole, yet overall ‘“anisic” of type."

952,"Dry and rather hard odor, generally considered undesirable, yet reminiscent of bera- Ionone in overall type."

955,"The odor is mere fruity, less floral than that of Dihydro jasmone"

2815,"The author agrees with the late Mr. E. S. Maurer (103-298) that the common description “pleasant floral New-Mown-Hay odor” is not only misleading, but also very incomplete. Even if the odor would be generally described as “pleasant and floral”, one should avoid phrases which almost imply or encourage a use of a hazardous material. In extreme dilution, the odor is warm, herbaceous, spicy-floral but the phenolic note remains perceptible"

3070,"Intensely sweet, balsamic-floral odor of very good tenacity."
3071,Pratt ically odorless

3089,"alpha-Vetivone has a powerful, warm, pleasant, Orris-Vetiver-Ambre-like odor of outstanding tenacity. It is generally considered the most desirable odor of the two.
